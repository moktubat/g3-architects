                        <p class="features-description">Architects do more than design. They dream, and they do. If you are considering a career in architecture, be prepared to do more than simply design buildings.

                            <p class="features-description">Believe it or not, but architects must be sociable. They must be able to clearly communicate with their clients as well as the interior designers, engineers and staff with whom they work. Also, architects must share their visions and ideas for a particular design and, in some cases, convince others of their goals.</p>
